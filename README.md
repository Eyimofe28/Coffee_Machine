# Coffee_Machine
The Python code in this repository represents a simple coffee machine program. The `MENU` dictionary defines different coffee options, including their ingredients and cost. The `resources` dictionary represents the available resources (water, milk, coffee, money) in the coffee machine. The `money` function calculates the total money inserted based on the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. The `calculate` function determines the change to be returned to the user after purchasing a drink. The `costa` function handles the coffee machine operation, checking resources, prompting for coin input, and delivering the chosen drink or refunding money accordingly. The main loop allows users to repeatedly make coffee selections, check the machine's status with a 'report' command, turn off the machine with 'off', or handle unexpected interruptions. Overall, the code provides a basic interactive coffee machine experience.
